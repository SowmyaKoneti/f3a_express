Flagrant Fowl Futbol Association Rules and Regulations
For Summer 2023
- 9v9, 60min on SLU TURF field (back up is SLU Med Field). 2pm, 3:15, 4:30pm
- Two 10 week sessions. First: April 23-June 25. Second: July 9- Sept 17.
- This is COED- We are REQUIRING 3 women per team per game and 2 on the field at all
times.
- 3 women present, 2 on pitch
- 2 women present = consequence is play a person down (9v8)
- 1 present or Zero on the pitch = consequence forfeit. (3-0 win)
Captains and FM should note and discuss these thing before game begins.
- One ball given per team (Mark has more). Keep them. Love them. Bring them. Maybe write
your team name on it with sharpie.
- A bunch of cones per team. We hope to have the field lined on occasion but also you may
need to use cones (n/a). ALWAYS BRING THE CONES. CONES MAKE SOCCER FUN!
- Bring your team COLOR shirt but also bring a WHITE shirt in case.
-IMPORTANT! If you foul or are fouled CALL IT! Don't be noble. Call the foul. If you are called
on a foul, it's the other team's ball for a free kick. Please don't fuss, even if it is a ridiculous call
(which it will be ;\). This helps us keep the game under control and not have to pay for refs.
- Don't fuss. If you have issues bring it to the team captain. We will work it out.
- NO SLIDE TACKLES.
- CORNER KICKS ARE BACK.
- NO PENALTY KICKS. The offensive team gets a free indirect kick at the 18.
- Borrowing players from other teams is in some cases it NECESSARY. If this gets abused there
will be repercussions (more frowns).
- Generally BE NICE...or else :)
- IF a goal is scored but a foul is called IMMEDIATELY after/during the goal, the goal still stands
UNLESS the Field Marshall is able to rule that it was a clear foul that would have impacted the
goal being scored or prevented. Fouls must be called LOUDLY and prior to a goal being scored.
- Regularly we will have volunteer field marshalls. They are not refs, but just settle disputes and
are available for help. Which BTW, if each captain could take a couple turns being field marshal
that would be great AND if someone on the team is willing, let MARK TUCKER know. This
saves cost and helps maintain peace.
Field Marshal duties:
FM is not a ref! The FM basically just sits on the sideline and watches, chatting with friends, and
if there is a dispute they make the call. Just decide who gets the ball or if someone is being a
jerk they get asked to chill. You don't have to be perfect in your decisions, just make a CALL.
And make sure the game ends on time for the next game. The captains need to be the ones to
keep their players under control, not the field Marshal.
Summary of Rule and Pre-Game Notes
(Make sure game starts and ends on time or close. Start time clock.)
The goal of this league:
- a safe and cheap place to play competitive soccer and have fun
- “Don’t be an asshole rule” We play on the honor system - please play fair and don’t take
advantage
- There are no refs - Field Marshalls will attend most games to keep games on time and
chime in just in case there is a dispute. All calls are final - just reset and move on
- COED - we highly encourage teams to have 3 women or each game and 2 on the field.
This is not heavily enforced for the time being - captains can assess and agree at the
beginning of the game just in case teams cannot meet this requirement
“Special” Rules to announce before games.
- No Slide Tackles
- No Penalty Kicks. Offense gets ball at 18. INDIRECT.
- Call your own fouls - if you foul, call it, if someone fouls you, call it. We do not argue
these calls. Stop play, reset and move on
- No offsides.
- If you have issues or questions discuss it with your team captain.
